= Concept for Jenkins Open Source Project: Modernizer Role for Plugin Updates

== Overview
In the Jenkins open-source ecosystem, plugins play a vital role in extending Jenkins’ functionality.
However, maintaining these plugins and ensuring they are updated to the latest standards is a critical and often time-consuming task.
This concept introduces the **community plugin maintainer** role, composed of experienced volunteers within the Jenkins project, whose responsibility is to help maintain plugins when a plugin maintainer is unable to do so.

The community plugin maintainer initiative helps plugins remain up to date, secure, and functional within the Jenkins ecosystem, fostering a collaborative and efficient approach to plugin maintenance.

== Key Features

=== 1. Role of Modernizers:
- The community plugin maintainers are experienced volunteers in the Jenkins project who have deep knowledge and expertise in maintaining Jenkins plugins.
- When a plugin is found to be outdated or in need of modernization (e.g., dependency updates, compatibility improvements, or coding standards), and the plugin maintainer is unable to take action, a community plugin maintainer steps in to assist.
- Community plugin maintainers are empowered to modernize a plugin’s codebase to meet the latest Jenkins standards, ensuring that it stays compatible with Jenkins core, follows best practices, and uses modern libraries.

=== 2. Mandatory Review Process:
- Before any changes can be merged, the PR created by a community plugin maintainer must be reviewed by another community plugin maintainer or one of the maintainers of the plugin.
- This peer review ensures that updates are consistent with Jenkins standards and best practices. It serves as a quality control mechanism to maintain the integrity of the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.

=== 3. Plugin Maintainer Role:
- Community plugin maintainers generally do not adopt a plugin in order to improve it.
- The **plugin maintainer** retains full control over the plugin.
- The maintainer has **one week** from the time a community plugin maintainers submits the PR to review, approve, and merge it themselves or indicate approval for a merge.
   If no action is taken by the maintainer in this time frame, the PR can be merged by a community plugin maintainer, provided the PR is approved during the review process.
- Reviewed changes from community plugin maintainers can be merged immediately to plugins that are up for adoption.
- If the **plugin maintainer** has objections to this whole process, they can opt-out of this new process.

=== 4. Objection Handling:
- If any objections are raised during the review process, the PR will **not be merged**.
  Community plugin maintainers are expected to engage in discussions and resolve concerns with the plugin maintainer or the community.
- This ensures that any major issues or disagreements about the changes are properly addressed before the PR is finalized.

=== 5. Collaboration and Support:
- Community plugin maintainers are encouraged to communicate openly with plugin maintainers, share knowledge, and provide support during the modernization process.
- The goal is not to replace the maintainer, but to assist in bringing the plugin up to date when the maintainer is unable to do so themselves.

=== 6. Maintainer Benefits:
- Maintainers who cannot keep up with modernization can rely on the expertise of the community plugin maintainers, ensuring that their plugin continues to function properly in the Jenkins ecosystem without requiring them to become an expert in every evolving standard or dependency.
- The maintainers can focus on the broader direction of the plugin, while the community plugin maintainers help with the technical details of keeping it updated.

== Process Flow
1. **Plugin Needs Modernization:**
   A community plugin maintainer identifies a plugin that needs to be updated (outdated dependencies, breaking changes with Jenkins core, etc.).

2. **Modernizer Creates PR:**
   A community plugin maintainer forks the plugin repository and begins the necessary modernization work (updating dependencies, refactoring code, ensuring compatibility).

3. **PR Review:**
   A peer review by another community plugin maintainer or by the plugin maintainer ensures quality and consistency.

4. **Maintainer Review (1 Week):**
   The plugin maintainer has one week to review and merge the PR themselves. If no action is taken, a community plugin maintainer may merge it after peer review, provided no blocking objections arise.

5. **Objection Resolution (if necessary):**
   If there are concerns or objections, the PR will not be merged until these issues are addressed, either by discussion or further revisions.

== Benefits to the Jenkins Ecosystem:
- **Increased Plugin Health:** Regular modernization ensures that plugins stay up-to-date with Jenkins core and current best practices, improving the overall stability of Jenkins installations.
- **Sustained Maintainer Involvement:** Even if a maintainer is unable to commit the time required for modernizations, their plugin continues to evolve thanks to the support of the Modernizers.
- **Community Collaboration:** This approach fosters a collaborative environment, where knowledge is shared, and the responsibility of maintaining Jenkins plugins is distributed across trusted, experienced contributors.
- **Improved User Experience:** Jenkins users can confidently use plugins knowing that they are being actively maintained and updated to work with the latest Jenkins versions.

== Conclusion
By establishing the role of community plugin maintainers within the Jenkins community, we provide an effective, collaborative solution for plugin modernization.
This ensures that Jenkins plugins remain compatible with new versions of Jenkins while respecting the autonomy and involvement of original plugin maintainers.
The process also promotes quality control and the collective growth of Jenkins as an open-source project.
